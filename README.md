# Bottle Me Maybe

A collaboration between Caetano S. and Haroun B. as Project no 2 of the Ironhack WebDev Bootcamp, Bottle Me Maybe is a simple express app which allows its users to exchange messages "ie: Bottles" over HTTP.

Bottles are exchanged anonymously by default. But users may reveal their usernames at any point.
