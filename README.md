# Bottle Me Maybe

A collaboration between Caetano S. and Haroun B. as Project no 2 of the Ironhack WebDev Bootcamp, Bottle Me Maybe is a messaging over HTTP REST API where users can exchange messages "ie: Bottles", with anonymity being optional.

To get started a user can fetch a bottle at random. They then can respond, which starts a conversation “ie: Crate”. Or throw it back into circulation and fetch another one.
